disabilitieslanguageASCII: American Standard code for information interchange
(128 chars)

Unicode: A way to represent almost any characters with longer codes then ASCII
(>1million)

CPU: central processing unit (does calculations)
GPU: graphics processing unit (produces video)
Network: several computers connected and able to communicate

Waterfall:
1. Analysis
2. Design
3. Implement
4. Maintenance

one step must follow another's completion
whole project designed before any implementation

Iterative:
- Build a small working piece
- add onto it with other pieces in small "increments"
- until you have a large working project

Interpreter:
* looks at and executes line by line
* python is an example
* the code will run perfectly UNTIL it gets to the line with an error
Compiler:
* looks at all code as connected
* execution is faster but it takes longer to start up ("compile")
* java is an example

"""Operation	What it returns

   x + y	        Sum of x and y
   x - y	        Difference of x and y
   -x	            Changed sign of x
   +x	            Identity of x
   x * y	        Product of x and y
   x / y	        Quotient of x and y
   x // y	        Quotient from floor division of x and y
   x % y	        Remainder of x / y
   x ** y	        x to the y power
"""

casting:
change a string to an int or vice versa

whole number:
integer

String:
"letters"

float:
any number with .

Boolean:
true/false

Assignment:
declare a variable "a=hello"

Localization:
the process of translating your app into different languages

Internationalization:
The process of making your app able to adapt and handle content in different
languages, regions, and cultures

Ethical Concerns(automation/all)
--> increased technology
* more robots = take our jobs
* more tech = more weaponry
* faster computer = crack password faster
* AI can impersonate people
-> social isolation

Disposal of waste
- burning in Africa
- landfills
- planned obsolescence
Energy use
- crypto mining
- turn off at night
Designing for mobile devices
- small size
- no mouse keyboard
- mobile connection
- less memory
- less graphics
- battery use
Isolated communities
- slow internet access
- low bandwidth
outdated devices
- very localized language

AODA:
Accessibility for Ontario's with disabilities act
