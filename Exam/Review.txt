ASCII: American Standard code for information interchange
(128 chars)

Unicode: A way to represent almost any characters with longer codes then ASCII
(>1million)

CPU: central processing unit (does calculations)
GPU: graphics processing unit (produces video)
Network: several computers connected and able to communicate

Waterfall:
1. Analysis
2. Design
3. Implement
4. Maintenance

one step must follow another's completion
whole project designed before any implementation

Iterative:
- Build a small working piece
- add onto it with other pieces in small "increments"
- until you have a large working project

Interpreter:
* looks at and executes line by line
* python is an example
* the code will run perfectly UNTIL it gets to the line with an error
Compiler:
* looks at all code at connected
* execution is faster but it takes longer to start up ("compile")
* java is an example
